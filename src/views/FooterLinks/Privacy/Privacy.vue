                need to provide information about your order (which contains
                personal information), to Unhar. This Privacy Policy does not
                apply to the practices of participating retailers, third parties
                that Unhar does not own or control, or to individuals that Unhar

                may have their own privacy policies that you should carefully
                review before providing them with your personal information.

              <h3>6.0 How Unhar uses location information.</h3>
              <p>
                You'll see a request prompted by your device for permission to
                share your location information when you sign up for Unhar,
                which includes location data collected via bluetooth and nearby
                wifi signals. As a default, for the best service available the
                app asks you to turn on location services "Allow only while
                using the app." We use location data to find drivers that are
                near shops and help them navigate to your pickup spot. We treat
                your location information in accordance with our Privacy Notice.
                ur receipts, to understand and resolve support tickets, to
                troubleshoot and solve software bugs.
              </p>
              <p>
                6.1 If you're using an Android or IOS device, you have location
                settings to choose from:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Allow all the time: We may collect location information at any
                time, even when you're not actively using the Unhar app. If a
                service needs "Allow all the time" we'll ask for your permission
                when you enable the service.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Allow only while using the app: We may collect location
                information when the app is visible on your screen or when you
                have requested a ride and during your trip. You'll get a
                persistent notification in your Android or IOS notification
                panel if location is being collected in the background when you
                are in the "While using the app" setting.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Deny: This option disables location services for the Unhar
                app. You can still use the app, but you'll need to enter your
                pickup and dropoff locations manually. Location information will
                be collected from the driver during your trip and linked to your
                account, even if you have disabled location services for your
                app.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can always manage your location settings in your device's
                location preferences.
              </p>
              <p>6.2 Sharing with Cities and Governments</p>
              <p>
                In some instances, we're required to share information about the
                trips taken on our service with cities, governments and local
                transportation authorities.
              </p>
              <p>
                To meet these requirements, we collect geolocation and timestamp
                data from the devices, bikes and scooters on our platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                We collect and store all data about the driver and the shipment
                when you place an order for our analysis. We do not share the
                information with third parties. Unless it is a request from the
                State, Unhar provides all information about the driver, as there
                is no anonymity for drivers
