              <h3>3. Our Services</h3>
              <p>
                Sendle facilitates the booking and delivery of parcels. Sendle
                provides its services in accordance with the Australian Consumer
                Law. Sendle is not a common carrier, and we do not accept any
                liability as a common carrier. Sendle may refuse to provide
                services at its discretion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sendle uses a range of third-party providers, including DHL. DHL
                requires that Sendle informs our customers that they are bound
                by DHLâ€™s shipping terms and that commodities listed with respect
                to unacceptable under these terms are not to be tendered for
                shipment. You can view those terms here. We have replicated the
                key terms in this document, and confirm that your agreement is
                with Sendle.

              <h3>4. Parcel Requirements</h3>
              <p>
                Sendle will only arrange delivery of parcels that respect the
                size and weight limits of the Sendle products. We reserve the
                right to refuse to take goods for delivery that exceed our size
                and weight limits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sendle will not accept possession of or deliver the following:
              </p>
              <p>- Hazardous, dangerous, prohibited or illegal goods,</p>
              <p>- Arms / weapons,</p>
              <p>- Living goods and perishables</p>
              <p>
                - Irreplaceable items or items with a value exceeding $1500.00,
              </p>
              <p>- Irreplaceable legal documents or money.</p>

              <p>- Munitions of war</p>

                Sendle has the right to open and inspect parcels at any time,
                without notice to the sender or recipient, to determine the
                nature, condition, ownership or destination of the contents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sendle also has the right to do anything deemed appropriate in
                its sole discretion, if we think a parcel contains goods that
                are listed in 4.2 above, or contains goods that have not been
                properly described, declared or that may become dangerous. This
                includes the right to destroy or dispose of the goods or contact
                any relevant authorities to do so. In this case, Sendle has the
                right to charge the sender of the goods for any disposal costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sendle is not liable for the non-delivery of goods under this
                Clause.
